      "Price Objective Change Improving macro, AI & SFV to drive sector growth 2023 was a year of recovery for the Online media sector after significant spending cutbacks and ATT changes weighed on growth in 2022. Global ad spend grew an est. 11% to $560bn above our initial $528bn est. (5% y/y). In the US, with a stabilizing macro environment and resilient consumer, the digital ad market growth was above our estimates, up 11% vs our prior 4% est., to $234bn, with 69% ad sector penetration (up 4pts vs 2022). For 2024, aided by an improving macro, increasing SFV monetization, AI driven improvements in ad targeting & measurement, and targeting execution at GOOG/META, we expect Global industry growth to accelerate 1 point to 12%. \n",

      "In addition to a stable Global economic outlook with 2.8% GDP growth, top 2024 themes include: 1) Ramping SFV monetization (Reels, Shorts, Spotlight), 2) AI/ML investments improve ad performance, 3) Evolution of LLM based search results (new Google search features, potential competition from Open AI, Meta, etc.), 4) New social media + eCommerce partnerships, and 5) US Elections and Olympics to provide modest boost to growth. 2024 will be an exciting year for products, including AI/ML tech (GOOG and META), short-form video monetization (META, SNAP and GOOG), DR improvements (SNAP and PINS), shopping integrations (META, PINS, SNAP), and SVOD ad ramp to capture linear TV dollars, driving US Online penetration to 74%.\n",

      "For 2024, we think recession probability is most important driver for the group (driving relative & large cap vs small cap performance), but product cycles, growth/market share outlook, mgmt. discipline to grow margins, and valuations will be major drivers of stock returns. US Online media group valuation at 5.7x forward year EV/Rev is 22% below 10yr average of 7.3x with large caps at 5.8x (avg. at 6.8x), and small caps at 5.7x (avg. at 8.3x). Among large caps, we prefer Meta for the ongoing Reels monetization cycle, along with: 1) solid overall usage trends around video, 2) under-appreciated AI capabilities (that are driving usage and ad spend), and 3) ramping monetization of messaging assets. For mid-caps. we recently upgraded, and prefer, Pinterest given: 1) biggest accel. catalyst in 1H'24 with Amazon deal ramp, 2) strong expense discipline that should lead to further margin/EBITDA upside, and 3) exposure to a rebound in depressed home furnishing ad category. We are raising our POs as we roll forward our valuation basis to 2025 ests. We are raising GOOG/GOOGL PO to $166/$166 from $149/$149, Meta to $405 from $384, Pinterest to $42 from $37 and Snap to $16 from $11.\n",

      "2023 was a year of recovery for the Online media after significant spending cutbacks and IDFA headwinds impacted spend in 2022. With declining inflation and an improving macroeconomic outlook advertiser sentiment steadily improved throughout the year and the Global Online ad industry, including China, grew 11% y/y, above our estimates entering the year at 5%, to reach $560bn. In addition to more resilient consumer spending than expected (strength in eCommerce & retail vertical), AI/ML integrations and new ad conversion tracking technology drove higher ROI and incremental ad spend. Finally higher monetization of short form video and US$ depreciation aided industry growth on a US$ basis. Growth in most regions exceed our initial expectations: US estimated growth in '23 is now at 11% y/y (prior 4%), Western Europe 11% y/y (vs prior -1%) and Asia Pacific (ex-China) 15% y/y (prior 7%). Looking forward to 2024, we expect global online ad industry to grow 12% y/y to $629bn, with growth aided by AI/ML integrations driving higher ROI and incremental ad spend, ramping short-form video monetization, and growing digital penetration as linear TV usage continues to decline. Following significant underperformance in 2022, all major US ad platforms have had positive 2023 YTD returns. A key question for 2024 is if small caps can outperform large caps as outlook changes to a more accommodative fed and lower interest rates. Meta had the largest rebound in 2023 (up 177% YTD) driven by strong cost discipline, ramping Reels and messaging monetization and growing optimism on AI/ML capabilities. Google (up 53% YTD) benefited from a recovery in the ad market, reduced threat of disruption from ChatGPT, and new product launches reaffirming AI positioning. Snap rebounded (up 69% YTD) on optimism regarding growing traction of company's DR solutions. Pinterest is up 44% YTD driven by recent acceleration in growth and optimism on further acceleration/margin expansion in 1H'24 as the Amazon deal ramps. \n",

      "Looking forward to 2024, our BofA economists expect a soft landing globally and worldwide GDP to grow 2.8% y/y (vs 3.0% in 2023). In the US, BofA expects gradual disinflation and a slowdown in employment with GDP growth at 1.4% (vs 2.4% in 2023), which could allow the Fed to start cutting rates by mid-year. For Eurozone, BofA expect dynamics to remain weak, while the China economy is expected to improve on the back of concerted stimulus action. Historical data suggests Online advertising industry growth and GDP have a high correlation, so we expect steady growth for the online media industry in 2024 and, if financial conditions ease (as inflation and interest rates come down), there is also potential for stock multiple expansion. Macro risks include: tightening fiscal policy in 2023 leads to downside in GDP growth in 2024, geopolitical conflicts impact consumer/advertiser sentiment, and regulatory changes in the US/Europe impact ad targeting capabilities.\n",

      "In addition to global economic activity, there are several other drivers that that could impact Online advertising spend in 2024 including: \n",
      " **Evolution of LLM based search results:** Since the launch of ChatGPT, \n",
      "Internet search has experienced a rapid evolution. Bing has partnered with Open AI to power search queries, while Google has introduced a number of new products to enhance user experiences and a potential AI competition has developed from Open AI and Meta. We expect greater LLM integration into Search in 2024 and believe it can increase volumes (new use cases) and result in more relevant ads with higher click rates. This can potentially drive an increase in search monetization and benefit Google with natural advantages for mobile including distribution and a larger feedback loop.\n",
      "\n",
      " **Growing role of AI/ML capabilities:** With growing limitations on user data collection, major online media platforms are making massive investments in AI/ML capabilities that should drive improving content and ad targeting. AI integrations is boosting ad spend at major platforms through campaign optimization, creative enhancement, and media buyer cost savings. Pinterest is also developing an automated solution (expected launch in 2024) that will help advertisers manage and optimize their Pinterest ad campaigns with less effort.\n",
      "\n",
      " **Ramping Short-form video monetization:** Major online platforms including Meta, YouTube and Snap are increasingly directing users to SFV content which is driving both incremental usage and cannibalization of existing features. In 2024, we expect SFV monetization to switch from a headwind to tailwind to revenue growth as companies enable more advertising around SFV content. \n",
      "\n",
      " **Social commerce and industry partnerships:** As time spent on social media platforms continues to grow, social platforms are playing an increasingly important role in consumer journey from research to buying products online. The industry (including Meta, Google and Pinterest) has gone through strategy shift from trying to aggregate seller products and complete sales/bookings on platform, back to lead generation/partnership models. Industry partnerships with Amazon and likely other retailers can accelerate ad spend by reducing buyer friction and increasing advertising conversion rates. Relative to its scale, we believe Pinterest has the opportunity for biggest incremental change from increasing shopping activity on the platform.\n",

      " US Elections and **Olympics:** In 2024, Olympics in 3Q and US Presidential elections in 4Q will provide modest benefit to global digital ad spending. Major sports events such as Olympics offer advertisers unique opportunity to capitalize on heightened attention, engagement, and audience reach while political ad spending in US sees a substantial uptick during presidential election years. While traditional media such as linear TV and local television still account for dominant share of spend during the two events (given the extensive coverage by broadcasting networks), digital platforms are becoming increasingly integral to these events & seeing increasing % of budgets.\n",

      "Advertising dollars generally follow user engagement and data from eMarketer suggests that US adult average online time spent per day has increased from 7.0 hours in 2021 to 7.6 hours in 2023, representing roughly 62% of total media time (multiple media can be consumed at the same time). Looking ahead, time spent on digital media as a percentage of total time spent is expected to increase 1pts in 2024 to 63%. Within digital, mobile video (7% CAGR) and social networks (5% CAGR) continue to be on the highest growth trajectory, with mobile time spent growing at 3% CAGR (21-23). Looking specifically at 2024, mobile is expected to see the biggest absolute time increase at roughly 5mins per day, with ad supported linear TV expected to see the biggest decline (down roughly 7mins per day). Total desktop usage has declined since 2016, now at 1.12 hours and is expected to decline at 4% y/y annually through 2025. All in, time spent on digital is expected to continue grow at 3% CAGR (23-25) fueled by mobile growth, while time spent on traditional media is expected to decline at 3% CAGR led by linear TV (down 4%) and Print (down 3% y/y).\n",

      "In 2024, we expect gap between time spent share and advertising spend share on digital media to grow, with advertising spend growth exceeding time spent growth. Digital advertising spend is expected to exceed overall digital time share by approximately 11pts (vs 7pts in 2023). We see 2 drivers of this gap. First, we believe search advertising is somewhat incremental to the total advertising industry, more of a COGS for internet traffic and less in competition for traditional brand awareness. Second, Online advertising offers superior targeting and measurement than traditional ad formats, which can result in disproportional market share for digital.\n",

The strong growth in local TV will be fueled by political advertising, with US Presidential elections in Nov'24. The growth in AVOD category growth is fueled by growing traction of ad-supported tier from Disney+, Netflix and increasing share of CTV (at the expense of TV). For Cinema, as audience continue returning to theatres, the category is expected to see above average growth, after declining more than 80% during COVID.\n",

      "We estimate Google and Meta will continue to have leading share of the US online advertising market, with combined share of around 67% in 2024 down 1pts (from 68% in 2023). Including Amazon, the combined market share of the three companies is expected to remain flat y/y at 83%. Meta lost 2.4pts market share in 2022 given targeting and measurement disruption on iOS (IDFA). However, we estimate Meta gained back 0.6pts share in 2023 (and is expected to gain 0.3pts in 2024) driven by ramping Reels and messaging monetization and AI/ML integrations (Advantage+) driving incremental ad spend on the platform. \n",

      "Google gained 1.9pts market share in 2022 as it benefited from increased ad spending on the Android due IDFA issues on iOS. However, in 2023, Google's share is expected to decline 2.3pts (with another 1.1pts decline in 2024) as Meta and Amazon are expected to grow faster. Other potential share gainers for 2024 include Amazon (+0.8pts) and TikTok (+0.5pts). Amazon is gaining advertising share as the company continues to see increased ad spend from its sellers as a percent of gross merchandise value (GMV). Among smaller platforms, we expect Pinterest to gain marginal share (0.01pts) benefiting from Amazon deal and increased ad load on the platform.\n",

We estimate Search will accelerate 2pts and grow 11% y/y to $98bn while Display (including video) is expected to accelerate 1pt to 13% y/y and reach $150bn.

In 2024, we expect digital ad spending in the region to grow 12% y/y to $121bn driven by improving macro environment and favorable FX. Regulatory changes remain an important risk for the region.

According to press reports, META's new LLM is expected to be as powerful as OpenAI's GPT 4.0, and several times more powerful compared to the company's Llama 2. In 3Q'23, Meta launched a new AI coding software tool, Code Llama that leverages generative AI to enhance the efficiency of developers by suggesting lines of software code. Code Llama will make workflows faster and more efficient for developers. The product can be used as a productivity and educational tool to help programmers write more robust, welldocumented software. The company also launched an AI tool, AudioCraft, that generates high-quality audio and music from text prompts and testing a new generative AI feature that allows users to create custom stickers. For Google, rapidly growing advertiser adoption of Performance Max should be an ongoing growth driver in 2024. The AI/ML tool launched in late 2021, brings together the best of Google's automation to help advertisers drive better results across all of Google's channels: YouTube, Display, Search, Discover and more. According to Google, advertisers that use Performance Max campaigns in their account see an average increase of 13% total incremental conversions at a similar cost per action. Also, the integration of LLM results with search will be an important driver which we review in the next section. Pinterest has grown its AI model size by 100x since 2022, that is helping drive increases in search relevancy and ad conversion rates.

LLM integration has the opportunity to provide more personalized and context-aware results across multiple platforms, shaping the way users consume information over the web. Within search, Gen-AI technology will enable new era of conversational search. While we expect traditional search to be most effective for the majority of queries, users will be able to interact with search engines in a more conversational manner, expecting nuanced responses akin to a dialogue. Conversational search features will also enable users to ask follow-up questions, seek clarification, and receive responses that reflect a deeper comprehension of their initial queries. This shift represents a departure from traditional keyword-based searches, making search experience more intuitive and user-friendly.\n",

      "# 5) Growing Social And Ecommerce **Partnerships**\n",
      "\n",
      "As time spent on social media platforms continues to grow, social platforms are playing an increasingly important role in consumer journey from research to buying products online. According to eMarketer, the social commerce market in the US is expected to grow at a CAGR (2023-27) of 21% to $145bn by 2027. The industry (including Meta, Google and Pinterest) has gone through strategy shift from trying to aggregate seller products and complete sales/bookings on platform, back to lead generation/partnership models. We believe recently announced industry partnerships with Amazon could accelerate partnership activity. In November, Amazon announced partnerships with Meta and Snap to give users on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat the ability to link their Amazon accounts and shop from promoted Amazon ads without leaving the respective apps. Amazon indicated US users will be able to see realtime pricing, Prime eligibility, delivery time estimates, and product details while on partner apps. If the ads drive higher conversion, Amazon could see higher ROIs, and spend more on social advertising. The eCommerce partnerships could be important for Meta and Snap for two reasons: 1) Adds more advertising inventory and volumes, and 2) Increases conversion with on-click sales for Prime members and 3) provides significant conversion data that can be used to inform other advertising algorithms. For Meta, the partnership could also accelerate monetization for messaging assets as the company successfully integrated shopping and payment features with WhatsApp in other global regions. If the Amazon deals are successful in increasing conversion on Amazon's social ads, we would expect other deals with large retailers with customer loyalty programs to follow.\n",

      "The Meta and Snap deal comes after Amazon announced a multi-year collaboration with Pinterest to become its first ever third-party advertising partner in April'23. With less advertiser overlap than Amazon, Amazon's deal with Pinterest seems more focused on increasing relevant ad loads on its platform, while the Amazon partnership with Meta is more focused on facilitating eCommerce conversion on Meta surfaces. While the partnership is still in early stage in 4Q'23, the contribution to Pinterest's topline is expected to become more meaningful starting in 1Q'24. Relative to its scale, we believe Pinterest has opportunity for biggest incremental change from increasing shopping activity on the platform.\n",

      "In 2024, two major events (Olympics in 3Q and US elections in 4Q) will provide modest benefits to global digital ad spending. Major sports events such as Olympics offer advertisers an opportunity to capitalize on heightened attention, engagement, and audience reach in a positive news/content safe environment, while political ad spending in the US can have a substantial uptick during presidential election years. While traditional media formats such as linear TV and local television still account for dominant share of ad spend during the two events (given the extensive coverage by broadcasting networks), digital platforms are becoming increasingly integral to these events. With the growth of online streaming services, advertisers are leveraging social media promotions, targeted online ads, and interactive content, to develop a more immersive and dynamic advertising landscape during these events.\n",

      "\n",
      "Implementation of Google Privacy Sandbox In May'23, Google announced timeline to phase out Cookies on Chrome in 2024, which suggested future delays are less likely. In preparation, Google has developed the Privacy Sandbox set of replacement standards and measurement API, enabling developers to test privacy APIs with live traffic. The Privacy Sandbox aims to create technologies that both protect user privacy online and give advertisers alternative tools for targeting and measurement. The Privacy Sandbox has two core aims: 1) Phase out support for thirdparty cookies when new solutions are in place, and 2) Reduce cross-site and cross-app tracking while helping to keep online content and services free for all. The Privacy Sandbox initiative also includes efforts designed to limit covert tracking, including proposals to address specific covert tracking techniques such as fingerprinting and network-level tracking. Google is moving toward the same direction as Apple on protecting users' data privacy, but the company's approach sems more collaborative with advertisers and developers by providing alternative solutions and more time for testing before implementing the changes. When Apple phased out cookies in Safari browser in April 2020, major online media platforms reported no significant adverse impact. Moreover, investments by leading platforms in developing AI/ML technologies and IDFA workaround solutions should also help mitigate the impact. \n",

      "In 1Q'24, Google will test changes to 1% of Chrome users by disabling cookies, and by 3Q'24, the company plans to expand the third-party cookie deprecation to 100% of Chrome users, pending UK CMA regulatory approval. In early 2022, Alphabet also announced it was working on privacy measures that would limit data sharing on Android smartphones, phasing out Android IDFA equivalent - AAID, which enables 3rd party tracking on mobile devices. However, since then, the company has not shared any definite timelines on implementing these privacy changes. Hence, we do not expect any major privacy changes for the Android mobile platform until the end of 2024.\n",

      "Source: Alphabet Website We see potential risk to Meta and Snap (though both are mobile app first companies), and Meta is well positioned to use alternative targeting technology and potential benefits for Google (search relative beneficiary). As for app tracking changes in Android, we see greater risk as Apple's app tracking changes were disruptive for the industry. Based on Meta's estimates for up to a $10bn impact from Apple's ATT changes, the impact may have been up to 20% of Meta's revenues on iOS. Google and the industry appear be much better prepared for changes in 2024, Google's Privacy Sandbox will replace third-party cookies with new measurement and reporting tools that will prevent people from being identified across different websites.\n",

      "\n",
      "In April 2021, Apple's rolled out its iOS 14.5 update and its new ATT (App Tracking Transparency) framework went into effect. ATT has created significant challenges for major social media platforms and advertisers as there is less data available on offplatform activities by app users. Since the iOS14.5 update, Apple appears to be taking a more measured and advertiser friendly approach with SKAdNetwork4.0 addressing some of the limitations on measurement (such as attributing app installations to specific ad campaigns and providing additional information while maintaining user privacy). iOS 15 and 16 had relatively minor impacts on the advertising ecosystem, while iOS 17 (released in Sep 2023) has also added some new privacy features, but they are not expected to be disruptive to digital ad ecosystem. iOS 17's Link tracking protection feature automatically removes tracking information from web addresses that can be used to uniquely identify a device and track a user across the web. This makes it more difficult for websites and advertisers to see which other sites a user accesses. Another feature, Privacy Manifests, provides websites with a standardized way to declare the data they collect and how they use it. The feature is designed to give app developers full transparency into how the third-party SDKs they work with collect and use data. According to Apple, Privacy manifests are, \"a property list that records the types of data collected by your app or third-party SDK, and the required reason APIs your app or third-party SDK uses.\n",

Platforms such Amazon, Walmart, Uber, Doordash and others are seizing the opportunity to position themselves as not just eCommerce destinations but also as advertising ecosystems with strong measurement capabilities and high ROI. These platforms recognize that the vast amount of consumer data they possess, derived from user interactions, purchase histories, and preferences, can be leveraged to deliver highly targeted and personalized ads. Moreover, privacy and measurement changes favor platforms with 1st party data, improving eCommerce platform's relative position. Amazon has gained significant share in the industry, with US ad revenues expected at $42.3bn in 2024 (up 18% y/y), and industry share increasing from 3% in 2018 to 12% in 2024, & Walmart's platform is growing faster than Amazon. \n",

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are critical in developing Gen-AI capabilities and illustrate high costs (and competition) in the sector. According to press reports, Nvidia's flagship H100 GPUs, which the company calls as the first chip designed for generative AI applications, are priced at an average of $30K-$40K and the and demand for these products is so high that the lead time of H100-based servers is reportedly 36 to 52 weeks.

      "Alphabet search deals In Oct 2020, US Department of Justice and 11 states brought an antitrust case against Google on the basis that the company anti-competitive actions violated the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. The case has since been consolidated with additional complaints from the DOJ and other states joining the litigation. The DOJ is asserting that Google has hurt consumers through exclusionary agreements and limit competition, including a deal with Apple making Google the default search engine on the Safari browser. The complaint alleged that Google has entered into a series of exclusionary agreements that collectively lock up the primary avenues through which users access search engines, and thus the Internet, by requiring that Google be set as the preset default general search engine on billions of mobile devices and computers worldwide and, in many cases, prohibiting preinstallation of a competitor. In particular, the complaint alleged that Google has unlawfully maintained monopolies in search and search advertising by:\n",
      " Entering into exclusivity agreements that forbid preinstallation of any competing search service.\n",
      "\n",
      " Entering into tying and other arrangements that force preinstallation of its search applications in prime locations on mobile devices and make them undeletable, regardless of consumer preference.\n",

A ruling in favor of Google could mark the end result, save for a government appeal, while if the DOJ prevails, appeals could last a year or two. If the judge rules in favor for DOJ, even in part, it will start a new phase to decide what the remedy looks like and, in all likelihood, the judge will reopen discovery so that both sides could do discovery on the remedy. Then there would have another hearing on the remedy, likely sometime in 2025, with a decision possibly 6 months later.

The complaints also allege that Facebook has imposed anticompetitive conditions on third-party software developers' access to interconnections to its platform. Our expert calls following the court filing suggested a low likelihood of a Meta breakup based on history and precedent. In June 2021, a federal court dismissed the FTC's antitrust complaint againstMeta and the case brought by 48 state attorneys general. The court ruled that the FTC failed to prove its main contention and the cornerstone of the case: that Facebook holds monopoly power in the US personal social networking market and gave agency 30 days to refile the case. In August 2021, FTC filed an amended complaintagainst Meta that allege that the company resorted to illegal buy-or-bury scheme to crush competition after string of failed attempts to innovate.

      "## Potential Loss Of Section 230 Protections\n",
      "\n",
      "Violence at the US Capital in 2021, and the suspension of Donald Trump's accounts on Facebook and Twitter has led to controversy and calls for changing the protections on user generated content offered by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which has shielded online platforms from liability for hosting and moderating user content. Critics believe online platforms have bias, limiting distribution of certain content, or are facilitating illegal activity, which shouldn't be protected. While platforms such as Facebook and YouTube are actively policing content on their sites (such as content related to sex trafficking), a rollback of Section 230 could increase risks including: 1) new federal enforcement actions, 2) potential civil liability arising from all user generated content, and 3) expense risk from need to Increase content review capabilities. In Feb 2023, the Supreme Court of the US (SCOTUS) heard arguments in Gonzalez vs. Google and was the first time that SCOTUS has interpreted the scope of Section 230. The Gonzalez family brought the lawsuit under the Antiterrorism Act, arguing that Google aided ISIS's recruitment through YouTube videos - specifically, recommending W \n",
      "ISIS videos to users through its algorithms. Previously, a divided panel of the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that Section 230 protects such recommendations, at least if the provider's algorithm treated content on its website similarly. The majority acknowledged that Section 230 \"shelters more activity than Congress envisioned it would\". However, concluded that Congress rather than courts should clarify how broadly Section 230 applies. In May 2023, ruling on the Twitter vs Taamneh case, the US Supreme Court reversed a lower court's decision, basically maintaining Section 230 protections for social media platforms. In the Twitter vs Taamneh case, the Supreme Court declined to reinterpret Section 230, concluded that Twitter and its peers had not aided and abetted terrorism. In a related section 230 case, Gonzalez vs Google, the court dismissed the complaint, referring it back to the lower court, largely because of its ruling in Twitter v. Taamneh. We think the case decisions could reduce the risk of further court challenges. The ruling suggests that it may take an act of Congress to change Section 230 protections, and there seems to be a broad consensus in the US Congress that Section 230 needs to be revisited. However, Congress is divided with significant disagreements on how to legislate the issue between Democrats and Republicans. While platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and YouTube are actively policing content on their sites (such as content related to sex trafficking), a Section 230 rollback in future could lead to increased risks including: 1) new federal enforcement actions, 2) potential civil liability arising from all users generated content, and 3) expense risk from need to increase content review capabilities. With the resolution of the Twitter case and Court's dismissal of the Google case, we see reduced Section 230 related tail risk for the sector, a positive for Alphabet and Meta.\n",

      "## Limitations **On Targeting Users Under 18**\n",
      "\n",
      "In May 2023, FTC proposed changes to its 2020 order against Meta, prohibiting the company from monetizing data on users under 18. The FTC proposes expanding the 2020 order, affecting FB, IG, WhatsApp Oculus, to add the following: 1) Total prohibition of monetizing data from anyone under 18; 2) No launching new or modified products or services without the independent assessor confirming that the new features are in compliance; 3) Rules also apply to any Meta acquisitions; 4) Expanded limitations on facial recognition, requiring disclosure and affirmative consent; 5) Strengthened requirements throughout relating to privacy review, data inventory, access controls, etc. The FTC has twice before settled with Meta over privacy violations. The Commission first filed a complaint against Meta in 2011 and secured an order in 2012 barring the company from misrepresenting its privacy practice. The 2020 order required Meta to pay $5bn penalty and expanded the privacy program. The 2020 order created an independent third-party assessor, who would evaluate whether Meta was adhering to the agreed privacy rules. The assessor recently submitted its report to FTC and identified several gaps in Meta's privacy program. The FTC alleges that in certain circumstances, Meta continued to allow 3rd party app developers to access user data (until mid-2020) even when the user hadn't been on the site for 30 days. FTC complaint also claims that from late 2017 to mid-2019, parental contact controls put in place by Meta were inadequate & allowed children to communicate with unapproved contacts via video calls and chats. In Nov'23, Judge Timothy Kelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied a motion filed by Meta for the court to take over the dispute with the FTC. According to eMarketer, in 2022, 6% (10mn) of Facebook users, 13% (17mn) of Instagram and 10% (6mn) of WhatsApp users in the US were under 18, which compares to 21% for Snap and 9% for Pinterest. Given teen targeting limitations already in place, and assuming general ads will still be allowed, we see less than 3% risk to Meta's overall revenue (US advertising accounts for roughly 45% of the company's total revenues). \n",

      "\n",
      "Press reports indicate that Gemini is a new gen AI model that is being developed by Google's AI arm, DeepMind. The model is still in training and expected to be released this Fall. Gemini was created from the ground up to be multimodal, highly efficient at tool and API integrations and built to enable future innovations, like memory and planning. It is the first AI model to be designed to be multimodal, and it is also the first to be built on the same infrastructure as Google's search engine. According to press reports, Gemini has the potential to be much more powerful and versatile than competitive AI models. It is also being designed to be efficient and easy to integrate with other tools and APIs. Once fine-tuned and tested, Gemini will likely be available at various sizes and capabilities, just like PaLM 2. Gemini is expected to power Google's existing AI chatbot, Bard, Search, and enterprise applications such as Cloud, workspace, etc, and, if the model lives up to expectations, we think Gemini could be quite positive for Google sentiment. According to recent press reports, Google has delayed the release of Gemini LLM model to 1Q'24. \n",

Risks for the stock include: 1) Still volatile macro and geopolitical backdrop may impact ad spend in 4Q, 2) LLM integration in search may take longer than expected or negatively impact search revenues, 3) concerns related new regulatory framework in the European Digital Markets Act (DMA), 4) adverse judge ruling on the ongoing DOJ search distribution trial, 5) potential for increasing Capex and lower FCF given AI focus.\n",

We think some conglomerate discount is warranted with elevated regulatory/antitrust risk, but longterm we believe that in-line to discount multiples are warranted given growth rates inexcess of peers. Downside risks to our price objective are increasing competition from offline and local retailers, AWS client cost optimization impact on revenues and margins, and regulatory pressure on the 3P marketplace.

Revenue drivers are a recovery in Online advertising markets, an acceleration in Reels or messaging monetization, and AI/ML benefits driving better content engagement and incremental ad spend.

VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst's assessment of both a stock's absolute total return potential as well as its attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). Our investment ratings are: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. An investment rating of 6 (No Rating) indicates that a stock is no longer trading on the basis of fundamentals. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 012 month total return expectation for a stock and the firm's guidelines for ratings dispersions (shownin the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst's view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).\n",

BofA ESGMeter Methodology: ESGMeter is a proprietary metric based on quantitative analysis and fundamental analyst inputs that reflects our assessment of a company's Environmental, Social and Governance-related attributes. The ESGMeter is intended to indicate a company's likelihood of experiencing stronger financial stability (higher return on equity and lower earnings and price volatility) over the next three years relative to peer group. There are three ESGMeter levels - Low, Medium, and High - which indicate whether a company has attributes most likely to translate into superior financial stability (in the case of a High level) or weaker financial stability (in the case of a Low level) over the next three years relative to its peer group. A Medium level suggests that a company exhibits ESG characteristics that are likely associated with financial stability results in line with its peer group over the next three years. Full details of our methodology, financial stability definition and disclaimers are available at BofA ESGMeter methodology. ESGMeter is not indicative of a company's future stock price performance and is not an investment recommendation or rating. ESGMeter is independent of the BofA Global Research fundamental equity analyst's investment rating, volatility risk rating, income rating or price objective for that company.
